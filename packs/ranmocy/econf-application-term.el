;;; Code:

;; M-x shell is a nice shell interface to use, let's make it colorful.  If
;; you need a terminal emulator rather than just a shell, consider M-x term
;; instead.
;; (autoload 'ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on "ansi-color" nil t)
;; (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on)

;; If you do use M-x term, you will notice there's line mode that acts like
;; emacs buffers, and there's the default char mode that will send your
;; input char-by-char, so that curses application see each of your key
;; strokes.
;;
;; The default way to toggle between them is C-c C-j and C-c C-k, let's
;; better use just one key to do the same.
(require 'term)
(define-key term-raw-map  (kbd "C-'") 'term-line-mode)
(define-key term-mode-map (kbd "C-'") 'term-char-mode)

;; Have C-y act as usual in term-mode, to avoid C-' C-y C-'
;; Well the real default would be C-c C-j C-y C-c C-k.
(define-key term-raw-map  (kbd "C-y") 'term-paste)
