{"name":"Emacs config","body":"# Ranmocy Emacs Configurations\r\n\r\nEmacs-Lisp is a very powerful language used by Emacs.\r\nIt is so powerful that sometimes makes people confused.\r\n\r\nThis project just aims to set some little rules to make the custom files a little bit more clearly.\r\n\r\n## Philosophy\r\n* Hierarchy\r\n* Modularization\r\n* Decoupling\r\n\r\n## File Rules\r\n* Every file here should be packaged to `provide` a feature and be `require` by others.\r\n* A file provide a feature to setup a package should be named with prefix `set-`.\r\n* A file provide a feature to extend a package should be named with prefix `ext-`.\r\n\r\n## Path Rules\r\n* Every customized files are under `customize/`, separated into different directory by categorization.\r\n* Packages are managed by `el-get` under `el-get/` unitedly.\r\n* Third-parties packages out of the `el-get` will be placed under `plugins/`. Never modified directly.\r\n* Themes are under `themes/` used by Emacs 24 integrated themes management.\r\n* Snippets are under `snippets/` used by `yasnippet`.\r\n* Everything sensitive is under `personal/`.\r\n\r\n## Code Rules\r\n* Atomize.\r\n* Auto-load every single file.\r\n* Duck Typing. Detect before use. Disable with a message better than raise errors with interruption.\r\n* It should be able to adapt Mac OS and any distribution of GNU/Linux without modification.\r\n\r\n## Contribute or Advise\r\n\r\n    Clone && Modify && Push && Pull-request \\n\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    Tell( to: me, in: ways.any )\r\n\r\nEMACS is a Evil Mixed A Configuration of S-expression\r\n","tagline":"for Emacs 24","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
